    <h1>Mini Buffalo Chicken Egg Rolls</h1>
    <img src="../images/rolls.jpeg" alt="rolls">
    <p>Long ago, in my more oblivious days, I ordered 'boneless Buffalo wings,' only to be disappointed they weren't wings. It's a bit ironic that all these years later, I'm using chicken breast to create a Buffalo wing alternative, but at least I'm not trying to trick anybody. Less messy than bone-in Buffalo wings and more eventful than the 'boneless' kind, these Buffalo chicken egg rolls are a party snack breakthrough. Serve alongside more hot sauce and celery.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound cooked chicken breast</li>
        <li>⅓ cup diced celery</li>
        <li>2 ounces blue cheese</li>
        <li>2 ounces cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Louisiana-style hot sauce</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>14 wonton wrappers, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice chicken into small cubes. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Add celery, blue cheese, cream cheese, and hot sauce. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix with a spoon until filling is well combined.</li>
        <li>Beat egg and water together. Brush egg wash over the edges of 1 wonton wrapper. Place a heaping tablespoon of filling near one edge. Spread out with your fingers, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Roll edge up over filling. Crimp in both edges and roll over once more. Fold in about 1/4 inch of dough on either side to seal the ends. Apply more egg wash on top and continue rolling. Place on a plastic-lined baking pan. Repeat with remaining wonton wrappers and filling.</li>
        <li>Fill a skillet with enough oil to reach halfway up the egg rolls. Heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a skillet over medium heat. Add a batch of egg rolls; fry until browned and crispy, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Fry remaining egg rolls.</li>
    </ol>
